        <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
        <p>The objective of the project is to construct a digital circuit the adds two 2-bit binary numbers(i.e 2-bit binary adder).If we let the first number be,A
        ,which can be represented using bits a1 and a0 and the second number , B ,can be similarly represented.<br>
        The design began with identification of the aforementioned inputs and the following truth table was achieved.<br></p>
        <img src= "hand_written.jpg" alt ="truth table" height = "400", width = "600"><br>
        <p>From the above truth table, the boolean expressions for the respective outputs were derived from the above truth table. The boolean expressions of the 
            outputs let to the below circuit.<br> </p>

        <h2>SIMULATION,TESTING AND VERIFICATION PROCESS</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">The digital circuit above was tested both by hand and with the Digital Works software.
            While testing by hand, we were taking random 2-bit inputs and performing the addition
            and tracing the inputs on the circuit diagram we had on paper to verify that it indeed
            correctly computed the sums as expected. <br><br>
            During the testing, we were using different scenerios such as when the inputs would not
            leave a carry (or have a carry of zero in other words). For that we were using many different 2-bit
            binary input combinations including the binary numbers: 01 and 10, 11 and 00, 10 and 00 being added together.
            For all of these numbers, the carry output being generated was a zero as we had expected.
            <br><br>
            We then considered other input combinations that would have the sum being zero but a carry output of 1. We
            used the numbers 10+10 and the output of our circuit was as expected again.
            We repeated the testing steps using the simulator and the same inputs we were using while testing by hand.<br><br>
            <h2>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</h2>
            We faced quite a few challenges along the way. Before we arrived at this correctly functioning circuit, we gave
            the circuit many attempts. In our first circuit attempt, the circiut worked for most of the inputs, however the input 
            with all ones gave an incorrect output. We had to tweak the circuit diagram a little bit, which brought us to the second 
            attempt. In our second attempt we arrived at the well functioning circuit,however it had 3 half adders which did not comply 
            to the given criteria. We optimized the circuit through logic synthetics, to be implemented with only 2 half adders(i.e fewer gates) 
            as required in the instructions.
