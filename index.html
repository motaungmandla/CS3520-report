        <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
        <p>The objective of the project is to construct a digital circuit the adds two 2-bit binary numbers(i.e 2-bit binary adder).If we let the first number be,A
        ,which can be represented using bits a1 and a0 and the second number , B ,can be similarly represented.<br>
        The design began with identification of the aforementioned inputs and the following truth table was achieved.<br></p>
        <img src= "hand_written.jpg" alt ="truth table" height = "400", width = "600"><br>
        <p>From the above truth table, the boolean expressions for the respective outputs were derived from the above truth table. The boolean expressions of the 
            outputs let to the below circuit.<br> </p>

        <h2>SIMULATION,TESTING AND VERIFICATION PROCESS</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">The digital circuit above was tested both by hand and with the Digital Works software.During the simulation process, 
            we inputed the bit sequences into our circuit inputs and the following wave-form and the truth table came as the ouputs of our circuit<br>
            <center><span><img src = "circuit_wave_form(1).png" alt = "wave form" height = "350" width = "550">
            <img src ="circuit_truth_table(1).png" alt = "truth table" height = "350" width = "550"></span></center><br>
            While testing by hand, we were taking random 2-bit inputs and performing the addition
            and tracing the inputs on the circuit diagram we had on paper to verify that it indeed
            correctly computed the sums as expected. <br><br>
            During the testing, we were using different scenerios such as when the inputs would not
            leave a carry (or have a carry of zero in other words). For that we were using many different 2-bit
            binary input combinations including the binary numbers: 01 and 10, 11 and 00, 10 and 00 being added together.
            For all of these numbers, the carry output being generated was a zero as we had expected. Specifically for inputs 01 and 10, we 
            were expecting binary 3(i.e. 11) as output and the screenshot is shared below!
            <br>
            <center><img src = "output2.png" alt = "output" height = "350" width = "550"></center>
            <br>
            We then considered other input combinations that would produce a carry output. We
            used the numbers 10+10 and the output of our circuit was as expected again.Specifically for the inputs 11 and 11, we were anticipating 
            binary 6(i.e. 110) as the output and the obtained output is shown below<br>
            <center><img src ="output.png" alt = "output" height = "350" width = "550"> </center>
            We repeated the testing steps using the simulator and the same inputs we were using while testing by hand.<br><br>
            <h2>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</h2>
            We faced quite a few challenges along the way. Before we arrived at this correctly functioning circuit, we gave
            the circuit many attempts. In our first circuit attempt, the circiut worked for most of the inputs, however the input 
            with all ones gave an incorrect output. We had to tweak the circuit diagram a little bit, which brought us to the second 
            attempt. In our second attempt we arrived at the well functioning circuit,however it had 3 half adders which did not comply 
            to the given criteria. We optimized the circuit through logic synthetics, to be implemented with only 2 half adders(i.e fewer gates) 
            as required in the instructions.<br> Another big issue that we faced was to correctly interprete the question as it had multiple parts.
            We had a challenge trying to figure out what each of the instructions meant, for instance, the part that says to briefly explain in a report how 
            the circuit worked, was followed by another statement that says to give a detailed explanation and a documentation about the circuit. In an attempt to solve 
            these problems, each instruction was carefully discussed amongst the group members and conclusions were made where we found common ground.<br>
            Even though we have used the simulating software tools before, those tools are not exactly easy to use and can be really confusing. Sometimes the little
            quirks in the software caused confusion about our design. We were also new to the deploying platforms and tools and those are quite confusing at first. 
            There are just so many files on the github platform and many sections in the page, one can get lost while navigating there.
            As a result, some members of the group had to make the time to learn about the advanced features of the simulating software
            (In our case, "digital works") while some of the remaining members were looking at the ins and outs of the publishing platforms. The gathered knowledge was
            later shared among the rest of the members.<br>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

In designing the 2-two-bit input adder circuit using two half adders and a three-bit output(C, S0 and S1), we navigated several challenges that are part of digital logic design.
Through construction and verification of the truth tables, we ensured that each possible input combination was accounted for, producing the correct sum and carry outputs. 
The use of digital works allowed us to visualize and test our design without the need for physical hardware.

This exercise not only reinforced our understanding of fundamental digital logic concepts, such as carry propagation and combinational logic but also highlighted the importance of strategic planning and troubleshooting in circuit design. We now know how to deploy our reports and any other compatible document to the world using jekyll and 
            github pages, thanks to this assignment.
